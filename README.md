Workout Log
=======

 This applicatoin was inspired from Mackenziechild 12 in 12 challenge
 I followed his video learning rails.

 Here are some differences between Mackenziechild's version
- use **slim** instead of haml
- some styles

### Version
none

### Tech
* [slim] - A lightweight templating engine
* [bootstrap] - Bootstrap, a sleek, intuitive, and powerful mobile first front-end framework for faster and easier web development.

### Installation

I use rvm with ruby 2.2.0 and rails 4.2.0. Because of spring, I need to use bin/bundle to make all extra cmds workable. I also exploit pow to start server. It is very convenient tool.

```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url] rails-workout-log
$ cd rails-workout-log
$ bin/bundle install
$ powder start
$ powder link
```

### Notes
